VeraCrypt is a free disk encryption software by IDRIX (https://www.idrix.fr) and is based on TrueCrypt 7.1a.

This is an experimental port to FreeBSD of VeraCrypt.
It was NOT created and is in no way endorsed by IDRIX.

VeraCrypt adds enhanced security to the algorithms used for system and
partitions encryption making it immune to new developments in
brute-force attacks. VeraCrypt also solves many vulnerabilities and
security issues found in TrueCrypt. The following post describes some
of the enhancements and corrections done:
